# Telecommunications Project

## Overview

This repository contains code for a telecommunications project focused on comparing the performance of different constellations based on multiple access. The primary metric for performance analysis is the Symbol Error Rate (SER). The project is divided into tasks, each addressing specific aspects of system simulation and optimization.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Literature Review

In this section, we provide a literature review of the assigned task, comparing the performance analysis of different constellations based on multiple access. The chosen metric is Symbol Error Rate (SER). Two systems, System 1 and System 2, are discussed, focusing on different aspects such as average energy, distance between symbols, and rotation of the constellation.

### Task 2: System 1 Simulation

This task involves simulating System 1 using MATLAB. The simulation includes generating symbols, adding complex Gaussian noise, and computing the Symbol Error Probabilities (SEP) for two users (UE1 and UE2) at different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR). The simulation results are then compared with theoretical values.

### Task 3: Optimizing System 1

The goal of this task is to find the optimal value of α at each SNR to minimize the maximum SEP between UE1 and UE2. Due to technical constraints, an array-based solution is presented with a note about its limitations.

### Task 4: System 2 Simulation and Optimization

In this task, a 4-QAM constellation for System 2 is considered. The optimal value of θ is found at each SNR to minimize the maximum SEP between UE1 and UE2. The performance of System 2 is then compared with System 1.

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/V1aGK/TelecomProject/tree/main
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd telecommunications-project`
3. Open MATLAB and run the scripts for each task: `task1.m`, `task2.m`, `task3.m`, `task4.m`

## Results and Figures
